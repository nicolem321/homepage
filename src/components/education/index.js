                                       This web app was designed when I was an orientation leader for me school, 
                                       I designed the app aiming to help incoming students to have all the information
                                       they need gathered on one page, recommend them American TA shows, and help them 
                                       manage their time better using the planner feature. <br></br>

                                       The goal of this project was to design a CNN model that will accurately recognize handwritten math equations out of ten categories. 
                                       Through the project, we also established a successful data pipeline that consisted of several augmenting steps, applied augmentation techniques such as random rotations and gaussian blur to increase the reliability and certainty of our results. <br></br>

                                       This Station Finder app was designed using Mongoose with the purpose of querying data. Users will be able to search up

                        Final project for Math122a - Numerical Methods and Big Data. We used a K-nearest neighbors inspired model to predict product ratings for 4500 given users. 
                        We tested out the model with two different distance metrics: k-nearest neighbor algorithm, Euclidean distance, and Modified Euclidean Distance with a hyperparameter search.
